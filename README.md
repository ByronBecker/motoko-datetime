# DateTime 

A DateTime library for the Motoko programming language.

**Caveat**: This library was made for a specific purpose and is a work in progress, so it currently only works for timestamps after the Unix epoch.

-> **Contributions & improvements are welcome!!**

## Documentation

## Inspiration

This library was heavily inspired by [Chronosphere](https://github.com/enzoh/chronosphere) from which much of the code was derived - credit to https://github.com/enzoh
